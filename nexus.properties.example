# Nexus Launcher Configuration
# ================================

# IGDB API Credentials (Optional - for enhanced non-Steam game metadata)
#
# To get IGDB credentials:
# 1. Go to https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps
# 2. Log in with your Twitch account (create one if needed)
# 3. Click "Register Your Application"
# 4. Fill in:
#    - Name: Nexus Launcher (or any name)
#    - OAuth Redirect URLs: http://localhost
#    - Category: Application Integration
# 5. Click "Create"
# 6. Copy the Client ID below
# 7. Click "New Secret" and copy the Client Secret below
#
# igdb.client.id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE
# igdb.client.secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE

# Note: Without IGDB credentials, the app will:
# - Use Steam API for all Steam games (works perfectly, no key needed)
# - Search Steam for non-Steam games (often finds matches)
# - Only detect system games from known paths (Riot Games, Minecraft)
# - Show "No description available" for unrecognized games
#
# WITH IGDB credentials, the app will additionally:
# - Scan Windows Registry and validate ALL installed apps against IGDB
# - Automatically detect standalone games (GOG, itch.io, old CD-ROM games, etc.)
# - Provide rich metadata for non-Steam games
# - Distinguish games from regular software (Blender = software, Sekiro = game)
